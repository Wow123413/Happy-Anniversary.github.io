            Hi love, it’s been a year now since we’ve been together, and yet it feels like it was yesterday. Ever since I met you, my life has become so much fun and worth living. You touch my heart like no one else. I grew up not knowing what love really is, but you, my love, showed me what love feels like. Having the privilege to love you, seeing you smile, being able to be with you, kiss you, hug you, hold your hand, do anything with you, and be a part of your life is such a wonderful privilege. Thank you for allowing me to experience your love, and thank you for letting me love you. I will hold and cherish this love for the rest of my life. You are my home, and I won't walk away no matter what. With all the uncertainties in the world, loving you endlessly is the only thing I'm sure of. You are the only certain with all the uncertainties. “When death takes my hand, I will hold you with the other and promise to find you in every lifetime." HAPPY ANNIVERSARY MY LOVEEE!!!! Yeyy 1year nataa.
